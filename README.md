üìç Local Anomaly Detection in Time Series

Local anomaly detection in time series aims to identify anomalies that occur at specific points or small segments within an individual time series. These anomalies typically represent minor but significant deviations from the expected behavior, such as sudden spikes or drops. The following papers delve into self-supervised methods and strategies for detecting local anomalies in time series data.

## üåè Global Anomaly Detection in Time Series

Global anomaly detection in time series refers to the identification of entire time series that act as outliers in a dataset comprising numerous sequences. The methods employed in this scenario aim to uncover global patterns that characterize the sequences across the entire dataset at the sample level. The following papers provide a comprehensive overview of various techniques and advancements in detecting global anomalies in time series data by means of self-supervised learning.
