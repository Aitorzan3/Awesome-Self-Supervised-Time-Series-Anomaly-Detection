## üìç Local Anomaly Detection in Time Series

Local anomaly detection in time series aims to identify anomalies that occur at specific points or small segments within an individual time series. These anomalies typically represent minor but significant deviations from the expected behavior, such as sudden spikes or drops. The following papers delve into self-supervised methods and strategies for detecting local anomalies in time series data.
