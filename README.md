# üìö Awesome-Self-Supervised-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection


Welcome to this repository, where we gather some of the most relevant studies in the field of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. These contributions are reviewed in our paper, "Self-Supervised Learning in Time Series Anomaly Detection: Recent Advances and Open Challenges", which is currently under review in the ACM Computing Surveys Journal. We hope you find this information useful. Enjoy! üòä

## üìò Theoretical Background

Self-Supervised Time Series Anomaly Detection is a specialized field that builds on two key areas: self-supervised learning and time series anomaly detection. To help you get up to speed, we've curated a collection of essential papers that provide the necessary theoretical foundation in these topics.
